## This is a Github trial

I will add some nice plots to see if it works!

Load Tidyverse
```{r tidyverse}
library(tidyverse) ## do this every time you restart R and need it 
```

We're learning ggplot2 It's going to be amazing. 

```{r data}

ohi_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/OHI_global_data.csv")

```
We start!!

```{r start ggplot} 
ggplot(ohi_data, aes(x=georegion_one, y=OHI_score)) + 
  geom_point()

```
